# web_scraper
It is a web scraping project that scraps the tabular data from a website into a csv file.

Presently, it is fetching the data of daily prices of different commodities from a website. It is only for the disrtict Pakur(my hometown), Jharkhand. I will try to implemrnt it for all the states and districts in India.

Here, the Indian Rupee sign is not printing properly. However, I found its unicode as u'\u20B9'. Still, not able to use it properly. I will find out the resolution soon.
